# Overview
CalculatorApp is an open-source C# console application that aims to calculate and output results based on a single string input. The application currently supports operations like addition and needs to be built with extensibility in mind. 

Designed to serve as a learning and contribution repo, this project embraces an inclusive and open community where everyone is encouraged to contribute. Any improvements, feature additions, or bug fixes are highly welcomed.

# Current Capabilities
The calculator can currently process basic algebra input containing numerical values and operators (e.g., '2 + 6 * 24.11 - 2^4'), and it outputs the result of that calculation .

# Future Capabilities
This application can only solve simple equations like 5*5, a*a, or 2 + 6 * 24.11 - 2^4. Please feel to add more features :)

# Documentation
This project currently uses this NuGet package.

# Quick Start Guide
To use the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo and compile the application.
2. Run the console app.
3. Upon being prompted, input a calculation string such as "20 + 1200 + 1".
4. Press enter to receive the output of your calculation, in this case, 1221.
